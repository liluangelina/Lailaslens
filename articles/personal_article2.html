                <h2>Paradoxical Patriarchy</h2>
                <p>Everyone tends to scroll through social media and occasionally stumble upon overly attractive women on their feeds. As a society that often consumes pop culture media, we observe celebrities such as the Kar-Jenner family and the Hadid family alter their appearances via facial procedures and surgeries. However, when young girls view these attractive Dr. Miami-injected women gaining popularity due to their appearance, we question how these sights are detrimental to their mental health. As a society, we continuously ask ourselves, "Who is to blame for the insecurities of young women?" and "Who is at fault for these beauty standards set for girls?". Although the mind of any adolescent is fragile and must be protected, I believe that no one is at fault for the established set of beauty standards besides us, society. This may come across as a blatantly obvious concept. However, some may take this for feminism and lack understanding of the internally misogynistic ideology that they perpetuate.</p>
                <p>In the previous two years, I have witnessed endless celebrities being shamed for any procedure they have done to their body and face. However, this was done with their money, their body, and their choice to alter whatever they would like whenever they would like to. When society publicly shames women for getting work done in any way, shape, or form, we revoke the established idea of "my body is my choice" to hold the truth only when it is beneficial to us and not all women. I watched celebrities such as Madison Beer berated by teenagers on the internet due to getting "caught" receiving lip filler. When she was called out for this, she claimed it was a mole removal surgery and was bullied for lying. Even if this was true, the concept that celebrities owe us details about procedures they have done to their body is absurd and internally sexist.</p>
                <p>The idea of getting frustrated at influencers and celebrities for establishing "unrealistic beauty standards" is not the responsibility of the person posting the content but rather the person receiving it. Women have full liberties to mutilate their bodies to their heart's desire, and no member of society should place their two cents on how another person's right to bodily integrity impacts them and their insecurities. As well as bodily integrity, women also have the right to post any harm-free content they would like without agonizing over other users' insecurities, judgment, and if the internet will “turn” on them one day for altering their bodies based on their personal desires. Ultimately, the media needs to step back and see the sheer hypocrisy in their words and actions. By realizing how sexism prevails right under our noses daily, I have learned to review the things I say and respect other people's choices and opinions, although I may disagree. Since at the end of the day, there is no one to blame besides us, society.</p>
