                <h2>Strapped by Society</h2>
                <p>Bustier, brassiere, or bra. Regardless of what you call it, all women hold the same belief that they're a hassle to deal with on a day-to-day basis. Whether you have an A cup or double Ds, bras of all shapes and sizes produce discomfort and binding on one's back. The prototype model of the brassiere comprised two handkerchiefs and a ribbon. In contrast to the now sports bra, bombshell bra, and t-shirt bra, the concept and execution of the bra has altered dramatically in visual, emotional, and symbolic ways.</p>
                <p>What does the bra even symbolize in society? Dating us back to 735 BC throughout the Roman Empire, women wrapped tight cloths around their chests to compress their breasts. Historians believe that this strategy went hand in hand with the modifications of social attitudes against women alongside their increasingly patriarchal societies. The evolution of the bra prevailed from this point on. The corset is a renowned French undergarment invented by Roxey Ann Caplin in 1851. Corsets are intended to "idealize" one's figure by cinching the waist, flattening the stomach, and lifting the breasts, as well as hyper-feminized women in a sexual demeanor for the liking of men. Corsets were worn as maternity wear, although they were tight-fitting and lung-compressing. However, the modernized adaptation of this undergarment was created in 1889 by Mary Phelps Jacobs (AKA Caresse Crosby) due to the discomfort of wearing corsets under her hefty ball gown. Following this, the invention of the bra began to evolve into what society sees it as todayâ€”a sex symbol.</p>
                <p>In the woman's eye, the bra serves the purpose of security. Whereas men view the bra as an enhancement to a woman's appearance. The popular movement, "Free the nipple," confused me because who said that it wasn't free? Why do women even feel the need to wear bras? Why is there such an uncomfortable and judgemental feeling when everyone in a room can tell that a woman isn't wearing a bra? Why have we as a society normalized judging women for their choice of wearing a particular undergarment or not? Considering this, we recognize that most men in our society establish these standards. When we ask the question, "How come men can walk around shirtless however, when women do the same act, the standard is completely different?" men will laugh at and enjoy the idea of braless breasts existing everywhere, yet when the feminist "Free the nipple" movements occur, going braless is deemed as "disgusting" and "inappropriate."</p>
                <p>Alongside hypocritical claims, men will simultaneously infiltrate the lingerie and female undergarment industry, essentially profiting off of a woman's desire to fulfill the societal standard of wearing a bra. The highest acclaimed lingerie brands, Victoria's Secret, Intimissimi, and Adore Me, are all founded by male entrepreneurs and led by notoriously controversial and misogynistic male CEOs. These are not the people women should want to be sold the idea of femininity and beauty from.</p>
                <p>In my eyes, if the bra had never been invented, society would desexualize breasts and instead embrace them as a regular aspect of the female anatomy in the exact manner of male chests. Why does a strip of exceedingly padded fabric determine my beauty and place in society as a woman, and why has everyone collectively agreed on this? I know that many women and I would much rather not have to adjust our bras constantly and experience uncomfortable bra fat and suffocation. Although we have free will, most women-including me- will comply with these standards rather than face the shameful noticeability of going braless.</p>
