                <h2>Skillset Over Silhouette: Achievements Speak Louder Than Appearances</h2>
                <p>Imagine walking into a boardroom; every gaze feels like judgment, every outfit scrutinized, and every word spoken carries the weight of societal expectations. Welcome to the subtle yet restrictive reality of women in the workplace, where the color of your lipstick dictates your intelligence, and the cut of your top overshadows the degrees you have earned. "You can just sit there and look pretty," they say. Femininity is a personal expression that refers to styles "traditionally" associated with women, such as applying make-up, wearing figure-fitting clothing, accessorizing, or styling particular hairstyles. Suppressing one's expression of femininity feels like a prerequisite in the professional world. From a young age, women are taught that femininity is synonymous with weakness. The concept of this suppression reaches beyond the visible aspects and extends to infiltrating the thinking and behavior of a woman. Society's expectation for women to suppress their characteristics in the workplace perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes as well as restricting freedom of self-expression. A woman's success in a professional setting should not rely on conforming to traditional masculine norms.</p>
                <p>From subtle biases to unrealistic expectations—particularly in male-dominated fields—the workplace can feel like a battleground where one's authenticity must be sacrificed for respect from peers. Over 53% percent of women in STEM fields agreed that behaving like a man improves their chances for advancement (Hewlett). "Behaving like a man" typically refers to adopting stereotypical masculine qualities such as assertiveness and dominance, and mitigating feminine expressions such as form-fitting clothing, make-up, and certain hairstyles. A study by the University of Colorado Boulder displays how feminine women are perceived in the workplace. Sarah Banchefsky, a postdoctoral researcher at the University, determined that according to 80 subjects, so-called "feminine women" were likelier to "fit" occupations categorized in early childhood- such as education- rather than scientific fields. In contrast, a man's professional likelihood was not determined by their appearance at all (Banchefsky). This study emphasizes the double standards women face as well as the reason behind a woman's suppression of their femininity and why complying with certain societal expectations beats judgment from peers and society. Despite their expertise and qualifications, this study exemplifies how women are pigeonholed into traditional gender roles and positions that are considered "appropriate" for their gender.</p>
                <p>Despite common beliefs, men are not the sole harborers of these biases towards women; women themselves play a role as well. It is genuinely heartbreaking to see how women also perpetuate biases, considering that many are victims of these biases as well. In the blog "Engineerette," the author recounts a personal experience with her mother when applying for her first job in engineering: "On the night before my first interview, I called my mom to ask if I should wear a pair of trousers or a skirt, 'Pants,' she said, 'because skirts will make you look like a ditsy princess who's too scared to get their hands dirty!' It was a silly joke, but I could see why she said that. Professional skirts are classy and conservative but also more feminine." (Engineerette). This narrative stresses a woman-to-woman dynamic of gender biases. Their mother's advice- intended to help her daughter navigate these biases- ironically contributes to this cycle of feminine suppression. By blending in with male colleagues, women can beat the stigma around appearing hyper-feminine in their place of work. The fact that a mother stated this speaks volumes and even further displays the rudimentary mindset of suppression women are exposed to growing up.</p>
                <p>While it is valid to argue that professionalism in the workplace requires one to fit particular standards of their private lives—such as their social media—and what is considered "appropriate," there is a fine line between professionalism and allowing women to be women. The #MedBikini event was derived from a controversial study published by male medical professionals, deeming that female doctors posting themselves in bathing suits on the internet as "unprofessional" (King). This study, later retracted, highlights the double standard women face in professional settings, which sets impractical standards for women. Of course, there is a blatant difference between wearing bikinis to work and posting appropriately in a bathing suit outside the workplace. However, this infringement on women's freedom of expression or policing women's behavior in their personal lives upholds a certain standard of misogyny that further perpetuates that one's femininity determines one's respect in a professional setting. The expectation that women must tightly curate their personal image to avoid professional scrutiny while men enjoy generous freedom not only sustains outdated stereotypes but also inflicts burdens onto women. The expectation that women outside the professional setting should not freely and appropriately express themselves while male colleagues are not held to the same standard is unrealistic and absurd (Justice). This raises an essential question about double standards: Why are men able to post freely on social media without their professionalism being questioned, while women who do the same face judgment and scrutiny at work?</p>
                <p>However, the possibility of change is real. Our society must confront and acknowledge the internalized misogyny that exists within our culture. Additionally, we must dismantle the stereotypes that suppression of femininity is the only way women will be treated without judgment, respect, and subtle professional penalizing. Though we cannot change one's desire to conform to specific standards overnight, we can begin to foster a particular mindset that challenges these societal expectations and does not enable them to dictate women's professional lives. We must empower young women and instill in them that their intelligence and dedication are not defined by how much make-up they choose to wear and recognize the humanity in everyone's right to self-expression. Our society always encourages self-expression, but we hesitate regarding certain professionals, especially those deemed high-status. Ultimately, we must create an environment where women feel their achievements and skills are celebrated rather than their appearances.</p>
